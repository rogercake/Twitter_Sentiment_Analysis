<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:30px;" > Introduction </h1>
Introduction Sentiment analysis refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics.  Therefore we need to develop an Automated Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Model in order to compute the customer perception. Due to the presence of non-useful characters (collectively termed as the noise) along with useful data, it becomes difficult to implement models on them.<br></br>

__Problem Statement__ 
- Classify the tweets by implementing any NLP approach for Sentiment analysis on the provided dataset. The objective is to recognize whether the given tweet is oriented as negative (-1), neutral (0), or positive (1) tone. Focus majorly on unique preprocessing techniques.
